        <h1>Game 2048</h1>
        <p>Gameplay:
        
        Board: The game is played on a 4x4 grid.
        
        Tiles: Initially, there are two tiles on the board, each with a number 2.
        
        Movement: You can move all tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right. All tiles on the board will slide in the
        chosen direction until they hit the edge of the board or another tile.
        
        Combining Tiles: When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with the sum of the two numbers.
        For example, if two tiles with the number 2 touch, they merge into one tile with the number 4.
        
        Scoring: Every time you combine tiles, your score increases by the value of the newly formed tile. For example, merging
        two tiles with the number 4 will increase your score by 4.
        
        Winning: The game is won when you create a tile with the number 2048. However, you can keep playing to achieve higher
        scores and larger tiles.
        
        Game Over: The game is over when there are no more possible moves left (i.e., the board is full and no adjacent tiles
        have the same number).</p>
