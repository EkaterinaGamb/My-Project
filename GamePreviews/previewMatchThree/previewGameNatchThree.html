        <h1>Game Match Three</h1>
        <p>Gameplay:
        
        Board: The game is played on a grid-based board filled with various tiles or items, such as gems, candies, fruits, etc.
        
        Matching Tiles: To score points and progress in the game, you need to match at least three tiles of the same type by
        swapping adjacent tiles either horizontally or vertically. When three or more tiles of the same type are aligned, they
        disappear from the board.
        
        Special Tiles: Sometimes, special tiles or items may appear on the board that have unique properties when matched:
        
        Power-ups: Matching certain combinations can create power-up tiles that have special abilities (e.g., clearing an entire
        row or column, destroying nearby tiles, etc.).
        Obstacles: Some levels may have obstacles like blocks or barriers that need to be cleared by making matches adjacent to
        them.
        Objectives: Each level may have specific objectives you need to complete to progress, such as:
        
        Reaching a target score within a limited number of moves or time.
        Clearing a certain number of specific tiles (e.g., jelly-covered tiles).
        Bringing specific items to the bottom of the board by making matches below them.
        Moves or Time: Typically, you have a limited number of moves or a countdown timer to complete the level objectives. If
        you run out of moves or time before completing the objectives, you may fail the level and have to retry.
        
        Scoring: Points are awarded based on the number of tiles matched and any special combinations or power-ups created
        during gameplay.
        
        Level Progression: As you successfully complete levels, you may unlock new levels with different challenges, layouts, or
        objectives.</p>
