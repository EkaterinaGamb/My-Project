        <h1>Game Snake</h1>
        <p>Gameplay:
        
        Snake: You control a snake represented by a line or series of connected blocks on a grid-based playing field.
        
        Movement: The snake moves continuously in a straight line in the direction it is facing. You can control the direction
        of the snake's movement using arrow keys (or other controls depending on the device).
        
        Eating Food: Randomly placed on the game board is food, often represented by a small dot or icon. The snake must
        navigate to and consume this food to grow longer.
        
        Growing Length: Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer by one segment or block.
        
        Game Over Conditions:
        
        Collision with Itself: If the snake's head collides with any part of its own body, the game ends.
        Collision with Walls: If the snake moves into the boundaries of the game area or into any obstacles (if present), the
        game ends.
        Scoring: Points are typically awarded for each piece of food eaten. The score increases as the snake gets longer and
        eats more food.
        
        Game Progression: As the snake grows longer, the game becomes more challenging because it occupies more space on the
        board, making it easier to collide with itself or obstacles.</p>
